# webbrowser
This records work I did 6 years ago on webbrowser. We developed two versions: a C# version and a C++ version. What I uploaded is a C# version. 
Together with the code, I upload two documents which shows what we do: collect the webpage content and do emotion/psychological analysis. I embed a webpage content
parser and naive-bayes classification in our simplified webbrowser. At that time, I was just touching the gate of data mining and missed a lot of important issues in this project (I mean this project is far from perfect). However, I love this project: it is the one who lead me to AI field.
